Title:  Assignment "Handout" (10 points) part of PROJECT #1

Due:  Please submit on Blackboard before Tuesday September 8 at 11:59PM (before midnight).

Deliverable:  Prepare a handout for your data collection "measure project"... In the lower right hand corner, in a small font, Include your Name, WSU email and WSU ID.

Instructions:  An ideal handout is one-side of one page.  Two-side of one page is also acceptable.  

Your handout should be designed to be intuitive and quick to collect the data.  You will need a basic form of name (such as "MonteS") on the handout.  

You will need to collect the covariates (See covariates TAB of measure.xlsx in DROPBOX: __student_access__\project_01_measure ): what units is being measured, dominant hand for writing, dominant eye for seeing, eye color, dominant swing of a baseball bat or golf club, age, gender, ethnicity.  

You as the data collector will also record Q (for quality) and M for minutes.  You will also design an area N (for notes).  Generally, you would make these notes privately afterward.  Quality is on a scale of 1-10 on data-collector perceptions of the data-measurement.  M is number of estimated minutes to do the measurement.   Notes is for notes about ethnicity, other concerns, or unique factors that data analysis would prefer.  [DATA BOX THAT SAYS "TO BE COMPLETED LATER"]

The handout would be able to capture lengths for both the "right" and "left" side where appropriate.  If a participant is only doing half of the measurements, make certain they are consistently always measuring just one (always "right" or always "left").
