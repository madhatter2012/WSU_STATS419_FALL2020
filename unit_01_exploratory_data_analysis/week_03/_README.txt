Tasks for WEEK 03

	* Submit your "data-collection" file "measure.xls" for Project 01 "measure".  Please be certain what has been submitted is anonymous.  Worth 50 points "03 measure data collection".
	* The schedule will move back one week.  "times square" and "interdependence" will be moved to next week (the midterm timeline will probably remain unchanged).  This week will be "upgrade week" where we take what we have been doing and wrap it in RStudio with GitHub version control.
	* Complete "03 datasets assignment revisited" which is a rework of the "02 dataset assignment" where you will build an R.notebook for your HTML sandbox and R.markdown for your PDF final product submission using GitHub to source your functions and the Latex template defined in this week's only video.
	* Interact with Lecture for DAY 05 "git r done" and take appropriate notes in your thought journal:  https://youtu.be/rnOh_mObGDU
		- The first 00:39:00 minutes are definitely the most important.  There is a latex-template tangent (about an hour) that was necessary to prepare a custom template for you.  Watch this section, but you are not required to try and replicate it.  The last section starts at 1:40:00 and gives you guidance on the requirements for this week's 10-point assignment.  All future R-based submissions will follow this protocol.
		- Create a github account if you don't have one already.  Be certain to note your primary email address (e.g., monte.shaffer@gmail.com) and your github username (e.g., MonteShaffer)
		- Create an account for stackoverflow and rstudio community (to be able to post questions).  In your journal, you should be writing down questions you haven't figured out yet in R.  Next week, you will need to submit a question to one of these forums.
	
Weekly Zoom office hours will be held on Mondays at 1PM and Thursdays at 8PM.  The goal is to offer varying times to accomodate the different needs you may have.  An appointment for other office hours can be arranged.  Ideally, create a group of 4-5 total students and make a group request for office hours.
